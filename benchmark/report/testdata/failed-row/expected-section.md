## Performance

Runner: local machine running Docker Desktop (containerized), amd64, AMD Ryzen 5 5500. Each proxy gets 1 core and 512 MB and balances round-robin over 4 backends, HTTP/1.1 without TLS. Each number is the median of 3 rounds. [How this is measured](https://github.com/aaydin-tr/divisor/blob/main/benchmark/README.md)

### Throughput

64 keep-alive connections, each sending its next request as soon as the last one is answered.

| Contender | Version | req/s | p50 | p99 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| divisor | main@aa36fa6 | failed | failed | failed |

Failed:

- divisor, round 2: answered 503 to 51200 requests

### Fixed-rate latency

5,000 requests per second over 64 keep-alive connections, latency corrected for coordinated omission.

| Contender | Version | p50 | p99 | p99.9 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| divisor | main@aa36fa6 | 0.31 ms | 0.69 ms | 6.19 ms |
